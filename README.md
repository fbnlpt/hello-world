# hello-world
This is my firs repository on github, hello!

My first commit:
- saved changes are called commits. They (can) have a explanatory message (commit message) stating why the changes have been made.
  -> this first commit will be saved to the readme-edits.file, not the master branch. 

My second commit and first Pull Request:
- when one makes a pull request one sends and shows the changes made in the commit to the owner of the master branch.
- the owner is now able to check and comment the changes (changes that add something are highlighted green, changes that removes existing content is highlighted red).
- if the changes made are acknowledged by the owner the commit and the master branch can be merged.
- the branches made from the master can be deleted after merging.
